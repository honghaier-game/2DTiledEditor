This is a 2D game grid map editor and some mini games developed based on InsCode AI IDE.
The 2D game grid map editor is developed based on Python language and tkinter, while the mini game is developed based on pygame.
The 2D game grid map editor supports both Chinese and English languages. You can create multiple layers of map grids in the editor and use them to create some small games.
I will open source them, and you can download them freely. If you have any requirements, you can also raise them, but there is no need to change them because I use AI IDE for development. You only need to give me your requirements and I will meet them.

Believe me, I am a developer with over 20 years of experience in game engine development, and this is just a small appetizer.
If you follow me and make demands, I will constantly unleash my magic to give you more surprises.
